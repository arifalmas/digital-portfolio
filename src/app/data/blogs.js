      content: `The push () method is the process of adding one or more numbers of elements at the end of the array and returning with a new length of the array. Normally, the push method helps to add the value to the array. It is a convenient option for using bracket notation for assigning one or even more key-value pairs with the object.
      The value gets easily assigned with the use of the push method. They are suitable options for adding the object to the end of the array. React hooks allows simpler code which is suitable for implementing similar functions faster even without any hassle. These are suitable options for implementing the React state along with the lifecycle method, even without any use of the writing class.`,

      content: `Most VS Code extensions in the marketplace have minimal testing, if any at all. The official VS Code documentation recommends using packages like @vscode/test-electron and @vscode/test-web which provide limited testing capabilities and a total lack of support for testing webviews. Although webviews may not be the recommended approach to building extension UI, itâ€™s an integral part of the UX surface area in many extensions and has some pretty compelling use cases. With VS Code extensions establishing themselves as critical building blocks in the developer experience, itâ€™s important that extension authors ensure continued quality and continuity in this complex and ever changing ecosystem.`,

      content: `React Native is a framework for app development developed by Facebook. It helps app developers easily make hybrid applications (type for both to access the deviceâ€™s resource and elements for web).

      A previous mobile hybrid application can display web by using a WebView, But still, it has a limitation to pass complicated process to access the userâ€™s mobile device resources such as device information, camera, storage, phone etc. For this reason, hybrid applications that were released in the early stage have been transferred to Native application. But with React Native, it is possible to access and use device resources by using JavaScript besides deploying on the web. So with only one web display, app service providers can use the app element as well. Therefore, React Native has become very popular with its advantage for service operation and fast app development speed.`,
